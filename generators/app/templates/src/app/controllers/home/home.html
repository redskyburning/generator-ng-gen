		<p>At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd near the water's edge seemed to me
			to be for a moment horror-struck. There was no screaming or shouting, but a silence. Then a hoarse
			murmur and a movement of feet&#45;&#45;a splashing from the water. A man, too frightened to drop the
			portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent me staggering with a blow from the
			corner of his burden. A woman thrust at me with her hand and rushed past me. I turned with the rush
			of the people, but I was not too terrified for thought. The terrible Heat-Ray was in my mind. To get
			under water! That was it!</p>
